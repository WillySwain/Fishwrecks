### Project Introduction

##### Description:
We will be exploring the correlations between shipwreck locations and fishing boat locations.

##### Questions:
How do shipwrecks affect total fish congregations?
Do vessels fish around shipwrecks more often than not?

##### Data Sources:
- [Global Fishing Watch](https://globalfishingwatch.org/)
    - This data includes all information about fishing vessels, their locations, and how long they were at sea and how long they were fishing
    - Format: date, latitude, longitude, mmsi (ship identification number), hours (at sea), fishing hours
- [NOAA Wrecks and Obstructions Database](https://nauticalcharts.noaa.gov/data/wrecks-and-obstructions.html)
    - This data includes all information about shipwrecks and obstructions around the U.S.
    - Format: record, vessel term, feature type, latitude, longitude, positional accuracy, depth, depth measurement, year sunk, history
